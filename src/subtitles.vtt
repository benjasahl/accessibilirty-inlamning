Steven: Hey game boarders, I'm Steve Nash.

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:06.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Michaela: And I'm Michaela di Cesare, and here's our review of Talisman.

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:10.000 line-left align:center size:80%
[Exciting combat music in the background] 

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.800 line-left align:center size:80%
Steven: This game by Fantasy Flight Games is awesome!

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:19.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Your character is in a fantasy world setting and he's trying to 
get the legendary Crown of Command!

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Michaela: Yeah, and you start the game by selecting one character of many

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.000 line-left align:center size:80%
and just placing him on the starting location.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Steven: What's really cool is that each character has an alignment;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.000 line-left align:center size:80%
he can be good, evil or neutral, and this affects how you play.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Michaela: The game is also very random;

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.000 line-left align:center size:80%
a lot of rolling of dices and drawing cards are random.

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.000 line-left align:center size:80%        
I mean sometimes the weakest enemy can defeat you,

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:46.000 line-left align:center size:80%
or landing on a square you really need takes forever because movement is by dice roll.

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:50.800 line-left align:center size:80%
But it doesn't change the fact that this game is a blast to play, when you're over four players.

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.400 line-left align:center size:80%
Steven: I agree, it's very random.

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.400 line-left align:center size:80%
You roll the dice to move, then you roll the dice to see what you get,

00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.000 line-left align:center size:80%
then you draw a card at random to see who you encounter etc.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.000 line-left align:center size:80%
But still fun and fast-paced.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.600 line-left align:center size:80%
Michaela: I like the fact that when you meet a monster and don't defeat him he stays on the board.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:12.500 line-left align:center size:80%
So the board is always being upgraded with monsters, shops and NPCs.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Steve: Speaking of NPCs, you can also get followers to help you in this quest.

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.000 line-left align:center size:80%
I love this part of the game!

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:21.000 line-left align:center size:80%
You can also have a mule follower that helps you carry more items.

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.000 line-left align:center size:80%
Michaela: Yes, but you have to be careful. 

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.800 line-left align:center size:80%
Some followers are actually annoying and can ruin the game for you.

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.300 line-left align:center size:80%
Steve: Okay so let's talk about the board. It's separated in three parts;

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.000 line-left align:center size:80%
the outer ring, the middle ring and the center.

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.000 
The outer ring is basically forest, woods, towns and plains.

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.000
The objective of the game is to get your character for the center square,

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
called the “Crown of Command”.

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.200
Michaela: So your character ventures for a while on the outside region

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.000
until he feels strong enough to go to the middle region.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.500         
You can get there by killing the Sentinel at the bridge

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.200 
or if you have an axe, build a raft when you're in the woods.

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:59.000
Steve: Once in the middle region you try to get a Talisman,

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.000
which is the key to enter the Crown of Command-room.

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.000
So once you have a Talisman

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.400
you try to enter the center region, where you can only move one square at a time.

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.000  
Defeat all the challenges, again mostly by rolling dices.

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.000 
Michaela: What really sucks is once you've done all the challenges

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.000
and are about to enter the Crown room,

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:20.800           
another player most likely has the “Steal spell”, which makes you lose your Talisman.

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:23.800            
And then you're stuck there feeling you just want to quit the game.

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.000
Steve: That's true, when that happens it`s the most annoying thing ever.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.600
Michaela: So once you're lucky enough to be in the crown room, you roll one dice when it's your turn.

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:35.000 
For every five, four or six, everyone else loses a life.

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.400
When everybody dies, you win.

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.500
Steve: But you have to be careful!

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.600
Because if another player comes into that room,

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:45.800
then you have to battle to death using only strength.

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.600
Meaning if your character is a craft-character, then you might get a beating.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.800
Michaela: That's why we made the house rule of choosing what you want to attack with.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:57.000
We just didn't see why a craft user wouldn't use craft to attack.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.500
Steve: So that's the overview of the game.

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:01.000
What did you think about the quality? The fun factor? And the artwork?

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.000
Michaela: The artwork is really nice!

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.000
The board itself and the pieces are very detailed,

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.000
beautiful character sheets and overall a really fun game to play.

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.500      
Until the other player steals your Talisman right before you enter the Crown room.

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:18.000  
Steve: I can't agree more with you. That pretty much sums up my score, is 9 on 10.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.500 
Michaela: 9 on 10 for me as well.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.000 
Steve: So there you have it folks.
